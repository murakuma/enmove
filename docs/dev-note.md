## Per-package configs

Before you publish the newer version of the packages, make sure that following attributes in `package.json` are provided correctly:

- **`name`**
    - Make sure it starts with `@enmove/` scope.
- **`main`**
    - If the package is only meant to be a pack of dependencies, remove this field. Otherwise, set the entry file as usual (`dist/index.js` for typescript project, for example).
- **`types`**
    - If it exposes a module originally written in TypeScript, set the location to the declaration file generated by tsc (i.e., `dist/index.d.ts`).
- **`files`**
    - If any contents of the package are transpiled code (from TypeScript), explicitly set this field so contents under `dist/` will be properly published to npm and we can prevent `src` files from being unneccesarily published.
- **`publishConfig`**
    - As it will be released as a scoped package, you need to explicitly set `publishConfig.access` to `"public"`.
- plus, `description`, and `author`

> **NOTE**:
> Always set `"private": true` on those projects that are never be published on the package registry (npm), for instance, example packages.
